It's actually a sidewalk that connects Coast Meridian with a lane that parallels Coast Meridian, and then continues through to Oxford. It is actually a common informal route that people take across town because it is near the Hyde Creek Rec Centre and it is a straight line to the east-west trail through the nature reserve.
